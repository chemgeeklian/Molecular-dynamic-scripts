This is a part of codes in for my undergrad. thesis. The thesis topic is Vibrational and Electronic Excitations of BeH2 in Ultrashort Femtosecond Laser Fields.

Concept is solving a time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE)by Crank-Nicolson method. Classical laser field is applied to a molecular.
