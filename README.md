# My-first-Gaussian-script
Calculate the energy of an CH4 molecule while moving a H atom away from the central carbon.

------------------above is the initial description----------------------

Considering add my self-writing scripts related to quantum/computing chemistry.

2018/06/15: add script of the rotation matrix to rotate a molecular in "obj" to match “import”, which was built in classical Cartesian coordinate system. I wrote it one year ago...

2018/06/16：Even if very naive, I would add the sort matrix to sort atoms into a certain order (distance to one atom)
